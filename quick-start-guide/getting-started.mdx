# Overview

Actionabl.ai is a platform that automates your business processes and alerts users whenever human intervention is needed. 

To get started, your team will work with Actionabl to define the business processes, artifacts (documents and records), and workflows. The Actionabl team (or your IT team) then implements those processes and artifacts into the platform on your behalf and then tests that implementation with your team. 

When you begin using the platform in production, it’s pre-populated with your data and process – all you need to do is respond to alerts and (if you’re an admin) make minor adjustments.
